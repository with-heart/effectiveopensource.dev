                Hello, I'm Mark Chandler. I'm a software engineer and open
                source maintainer from Cincinnati, Ohio.

                I've always been passionate about open source development, which
                is the process of creating software through global, voluntary
                communities built around cooperation and knowledge-sharing. I
                care about open source stewardship because I've experienced the
                open source process from every directionâ€”as a consumer, a
                contributor, and a maintainerâ€”and I know first-hand how
                difficult it is to coordinate open source development in a way
                that produces effective software backed by a healthy, dynamic,
                and open community.

                Every week, I publish content on effectiveopensource.dev
                exploring topics related to effective open source stewardship,
                such as community-building, accessible documentation,
                contribution processes, and project planning and tooling.

                These articles are for open source maintainers who want to
                expand the possibilities of their projects and build vibrants
                communities to support them.
