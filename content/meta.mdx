  'Celebrating the (mostly) open source technology behind
  effectiveopensource.dev'
---

This page is titled "Meta" because its purpose is to explore the technologies
that power the effectiveopensource.dev site. Not all of these technologies are
open source (like Vercel), but those that aren't are still near and dear to the
open source community.

Did you know that effectiveopensource.dev is itself an open source project?
Check out our code at
[github.com/with-heart/effectiveopensource.dev](https://github.com/with-heart/effectiveopensource.dev)!

## Writing

### [Markdown]

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to add element
formatting to plaintext documents.

```md
# This is an h1 heading

## This is an h2 heading

[A link to Google](https://google.com/)

How about some **bold** and _italic_ text?

- Markdown is great for making lists!
  - You can even nest them!
- Have another item
  - And another nested thing
```

Markdown is the language of open source. It's easy to read and easy to write.

We use it to write our READMEs. We use it to write issues, pull requests, and
comments. Heck, this post is written in Markdown!

Reading and writing Markdown is an essential soft skill in the open source
world. If you can't speak it, I highly recommend that you [invest time into
learning how][markdownguide]!

### [`mdx`][mdx]

If Markdown is the language of open source then MDX is its most advanced
dialect.

MDX allows authors to write JSX in their Markdown documents, providing a large
amount of power over customizing the document output.

### [Unified]

Unified is a unified collective of packages that compile content to syntax trees
and syntax trees to content.

This is powerful because we can write utilities and plugins that manipulate the
syntax tree in order to effect change in the content.

Even better is that Unified and MDX play well together, allowing us to modify
our Markdown documents with Unified.

As an example, the code blocks on effectiveopensource.dev are written in
Markdown, connected to MDX, and manipulated by [rehype] (a library in the
Unified collective) in order to add line numbers, syntax highlighting,
individual word highlighting, and more!

```jsx line=3 showLineNumbers=true
function hello() {
  // I'm a comment
  const variable = "I'm on the highlighted line!"
  return variable
}
```

Speaking of the code blocks, huge shout-out to [Pedro Duarte][pedro] for his
post ["Code blocks, but better"][bettercodeblocks] which serves as the
foundation for our code blocks.

## Styling

### [`@stitches/react`][stitches]

Stitches is the CSS-in-JS library used to style the components that render this
site.

I chose Stitches because:

- it features near-zero runtime and SSR support, which means the styles are
  almost entirely pre-generated so you're only served the bare minimum styles
  needed for each page
- it allows you to roll your own theme-powered style system from scratch
- its `variants` api is excellent; [Boolean Variants][booleanvariants] are my
  favorite feature!
  - for more info on variants, check out another awesome post by Pedro Duarte: [
    "Variant-driven Components"][variantdrivencomponents]

I also want to mention [TailwindCSS][tailwindcss] here because I built a `Prose`
component using Stitches that is partially a clone of the [TailwindCSS
Typography][tailwindtypography] `prose` styles.

### [Night Owl][nightowl]

Our code block theme is a modified version of the open source Night Owl theme
created by [Sarah Drasner][sdras].

```ts
const isThemeAwesome = (theme: {name: string}) => {
  return theme.name === 'nightOwl'
}
```

## Fonts

The fonts used on effectiveopensource.dev:

- Heading: [Newsreader]
- Body: Your operating system's UI font
- Monospace: [Source Code Pro][sourcecodepro]

The non-system fonts are imported using [Fontsource], an open source solution
for self-hosting open source fonts.
