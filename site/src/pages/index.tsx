              Hello, I'm Mark Chandler. I'm a software engineer and open source
              maintainer from Cincinnati, Ohio.

              I've always been passionate about open source development, which
              is the process of creating software through global, voluntary
              communities built around cooperation and knowledge-sharing. I care
              about open source stewardship because I've experienced the open
              source process from every directionâ€”as a consumer, a contributor,
              and a maintainerâ€”and I know first-hand how difficult it is to
              coordinate open source development in a way that produces
              effective software backed by a healthy, dynamic, and open
              community.

              Every week, I publish content on effectiveopensource.dev exploring
              topics related to effective open source stewardship, such as
              community-building, accessible documentation, contribution
              processes, and project planning and tooling.

              These articles are for open source maintainers who want to expand
              the possibilities of their projects and build vibrants communities
              to support them.
