- a place for planting ideas and growing them over time with love and attention
- it's like a blog in the sense that they both have published content
- it's unlike a blog in that the goal of a digital garden is to publish things
  before they're complete
  - "complete" is a bullshit idea
    - leads to paralysis for perfectionists (that's me!)
    - assumes an idea can be complete if only you spend enough time on it before
      publishing
- this page in its current state is a perfect example
  - since I'm just getting started, this content exists in a rough form (a seed)
    - it's just a bulleted list of points
    - hopefully that's enough for the concept to generally make sense to you
    - but for now, it's better for the content to exist than to not exist
      - the idea is out of my head and available to others (like you!)
  - over time, I'll spend more time and effort into growing this page into full
    sentences with better explanations, graphics, etc. (sprouting and growing)
    - as I think more about it and
      [you share feedback with me](https://twitter.com/grow_love) about it, I'll
      come back and improve it
  - I hope that someday this page is a shining explanation of a digital garden
    (mature plant)
