Hi, I'm [`with-heart`](https://github.com/with-heart)! I'm a software engineer
and open source maintainer from Cincinnati, Ohio.

I've always been passionate about open source development, which is the process
of creating software through global, voluntary communities built around
cooperation and knowledge-sharing. I care about open source stewardship because
I've experienced the open source process from every direction—as a consumer, a
contributor, and a maintainer—and I know first-hand how difficult it is to
coordinate open source development in a way that produces effective software
backed by a healthy, dynamic, and open community.

I publish content on effectiveopensource.dev exploring topics related to
effective open source stewardship, such as community-building, accessible
documentation, contribution processes, and project planning and tooling.

These articles are for open source maintainers who want to expand the
possibilities of their projects and build vibrants communities to support them.
